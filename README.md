# Tic-Tac-Toe
1. **Game Objective:**
   - Two players take turns playing, with the X player starting first.
   - The goal is to form a line of five symbols in a row on the 5x5 game board, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. **Gameplay Steps:**
   - The X player chooses a position on the board to place their symbol (a number from 1 to 25).
   - Subsequently, the computer O makes its move by selecting an available position, also choosing from the numbers 1 to 25.
   - Players and the computer take turns until one player achieves a line of five symbols in a row or until all grid spaces are occupied.

3. **Victory Conditions:**
   - A player wins when they have five consecutive identical symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.
   - If all grid spaces are occupied, and no player achieves a line, the game is declared a draw.
